H2 apparently does not allow PHANTOM READs as they don't appear in isolation level REPEATABLE READ.

Sometimes and randomly H2 actually eliminates them in READ COMMMITTED. Example:

Non-Repeatable Read, isolation level READ_COMMITTED, operation UpdateIntoPredicateSet, predicate ByEnsembleAndPayload, expecting PhantomRead
